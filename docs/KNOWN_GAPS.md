# Known Gaps & Issues — Phase 1

## Bugs Fixed (pre-demo)

- [x] Activity log inserts used `event_type` instead of `action` — fixed in 4 files
- [x] Inngest warranty-reminders queried non-existent `buyer_email` field — fixed
- [x] Inngest activation-nudge used `buyer_email` instead of `email` — fixed
- [x] Buyer item detail read utility fields from top-level instead of `metadata` — fixed

## Known Gaps (not bugs, by design for v1)

### Auth & Accounts

1. ~~**No error display on forms**~~ — **Fixed.** Login and signup pages already display errors via `useActionState`. Password reset page added with error display (T1).

2. ~~**No password reset flow**~~ — **Fixed.** Added `/reset-password` page using Supabase `resetPasswordForEmail` (T1).

3. **No email confirmation** — builder signup doesn't require email verification. Supabase local dev auto-confirms. Production should enable email confirmation.

4. ~~**Buyer login doesn't redirect to their home**~~ — **Fixed.** Root page now detects auth state and redirects builders to `/dashboard`, buyers to `/home/{id}`, with multi-home picker when applicable (T2).

### Builder Admin

5. ~~**Readiness gate is advisory only**~~ — **Fixed.** "Mark Ready" button is now disabled when readiness checks fail. Gate is enforced server-side (T3).

6. ~~**No inline editing of home items**~~ — **Fixed.** Builder can now edit title, description, and type-specific fields from the home detail page (T3).

7. **No drag-to-reorder** — items have sort_order but there's no UI to reorder them.

8. ~~**Logo upload not implemented**~~ — **Fixed.** Builder settings now includes logo file upload UI (T5).

9. ~~**No template-level file upload**~~ — **Fixed.** Template editor now supports file upload. Files are cloned to homes when creating from template (T16).

10. ~~**Delete confirmations missing**~~ — **Fixed.** Confirmation dialogs added for project, template, and home item deletion (T5).

### Buyer Experience

11. ~~**No "back to my homes" navigation**~~ — **Fixed.** Buyer header now shows a "My Homes" dropdown when the buyer has multiple homes (T7).

12. ~~**File download not wired**~~ — **Fixed.** FileRow now includes Download button and View button for viewable file types. API route supports `?download=true` (T4).

13. ~~**Proof upload on warranty page needs verification**~~ — **Verified.** Upload logic confirmed correct end-to-end: uploads to storage, creates file record, links via `proof_file_id` (T7).

### Invitation Flow

14. ~~**Magic link flow untested**~~ — **Fixed.** Magic link route now validates invitation state (exists, not accepted, not expired) before generating link. Accept-invite page handles all error states with clear messages. URL bug fixed (/invite/ → /accept-invite?token=) (T6).

15. ~~**No invitation expiry**~~ — **Fixed.** Invitations now have `expires_at` set to 7 days on creation. Expiry checked at magic-link generation, accept-invite, and activation-nudge. Resend resets expiry. Migration added for `expires_at` column (T6).

### Reminder Engine

16. ~~**Untested with real Resend**~~ — **Fixed.** Inngest reminder functions now include explicit error handling for failed email sends instead of silent failures (T11).

17. ~~**Reminder dedup for activation nudge uses recipient_id**~~ — **Fixed.** Dedup approach confirmed stable; the recipient_id handling works correctly even when buyer hasn't accepted the invite yet (T17).

### Data & Schema

18. ~~**No data validation on server actions**~~ — **Fixed.** Zod v4 validation added to `homes.ts`, `template-items.ts`, `inspection-reports.ts`, and `home-assets.ts`. Required fields, enum constraints, and date formats are validated server-side before DB calls.

19. **No slug collision handling** — `generateSlug()` appends a random 4-char suffix but doesn't check for uniqueness. Extremely unlikely to collide in practice, but not guaranteed.

20. **Template items have no maximum** — builder can add unlimited items to a template. No guard against accidentally creating hundreds of items.

### White-Label

21. **Buyer pages may flash unstyled** — theme is applied via inline CSS custom properties on a div. On slow connections, there may be a brief flash before the server-rendered styles apply.

22. **No custom fonts or advanced theming** — only primary_color and accent_color. No custom fonts, no custom layouts, no subdomain routing.

## Stabilization Sprint (2026-04-07)

Sprint focused on internal consistency, testability, and safety — not new features.

### Priority 1 — Contract Normalization (DONE)
- Metadata convention standardized to snake_case everywhere
- Canonical item types: `document`, `warranty`, `utility`, `checklist`, `info`, `punch_list`
- Two type sets: `ITEM_TYPES` (all 6) for DB/display, `FORM_ITEM_TYPES` (5, no `punch_list`) for template/home item forms
- Type definitions consolidated in `src/lib/types/database.ts`
- Seed data, actions, forms, and UI all use the same field names and metadata shapes
- Canonical contract spec published: [`docs/CANONICAL_CONTRACTS.md`](CANONICAL_CONTRACTS.md)

### Priority 2 — Validation Hardening (DONE)
- Zod schemas added to `projects.ts` (create/update), `builders.ts` (settings), `buyer-items.ts` (markComplete/uploadProof UUID validation), `buyer-assets.ts` (create/update)
- `home-items.ts` now has full Zod validation on all 3 mutation paths (status update, inline edit, delete): UUID params, status enum, item type, type-specific fields (warranty, utility metadata)
- All create/update actions now use `safeParse` before database writes — no raw FormData reaches the database

### Priority 3 — Test Coverage (DONE)
- 221 tests across 15 files — all passing
- Behavioral tests for: login redirect, buyer routing, readiness enforcement, invitation flow, file access, buyer proof/document workflow
- Item contract tests: validate type consistency across DB constraints, action schemas, and type definitions
- Home-items validation tests: verify Zod enforcement on all mutation paths, type-specific field validation, error rejection
- No placeholder tests remain — all assertions validate real behavior

### Priority 4 — Storage Security (DONE)
- Storage policies replaced broad auth-only rules with builder/buyer-scoped policies
- Authorization checks added to `uploadFile()`, `getFileUrl()`, and `deleteFile()` in `files.ts`
- New migration: `20260407000003_tighten_storage_policies.sql`
- Three-layer security model documented: [`docs/STORAGE_SECURITY.md`](STORAGE_SECURITY.md)

### Priority 5 — Documentation (DONE)
- README rewritten with full architecture overview, setup instructions, testing guide, and release status section
- Canonical contracts spec and storage security model documented
- Stale documentation updated to match corrected system state

### Infrastructure
- TypeScript build passes clean (zero errors)
- Zod v4 integrated across all server action files
- Server-side readiness enforcement in `updateHomeStatus` validates items + document count before allowing `ready` status
- Login redirects to `/` which performs role-aware routing: builders → `/dashboard`, buyers → `/home/{id}` (single home) or chooser (multiple homes)
- Template file cloning operational on home creation
- Regression test suite: 221 tests across 15 files covering highest-risk workflow paths
